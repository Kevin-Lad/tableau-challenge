## Analysis
*Map Trends:

The majority of the Citibike Trips end on Manhattan as opposed to the other boroughs of New York City. If you assume that most people live in another borough or state, and commute to Manhattan, then this trend makes sense. 


*Most Popular Start Time:

You can see on the graph, that there is a surge in rides for people going to work around 7 AM to 8 AM. There is an even greater amount of rides in the evening when people are going home from work. 

For the map of the most popular start times, I filtered out the locations that have 300 or more trips that begin at one of the most popular times, 8 AM. There are 14 locations that meet this criteria. This information is very helpful in planning, there is an obvious need for bicycles at these locations each morning. 

*Most Popular Place to Start/End a Ride:

The bar charts for both the most popular place to start/end a ride are almost identical. A quick internet search shows that these locations are very near to public transit, either the subway or bus station. This makes sense because the people who are using mass transit are not driving their own car, so they either go on foot or take a CitiBike.
